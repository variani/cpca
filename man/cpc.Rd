\title{Function cpc.}
\usage{
cpc(X, method = "stepwise", k = 0, iter = 30, threshold = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An array of three dimensions: the 3rd dimension encodes the groups
and the first two dimension contain the covariance matrices.}

\item{method}{The name of the method for computing the CPCA.
The default value is \code{"stepwise"}, which is the stepwise algorithm by Trendafilov.}

\item{k}{The number of components to be computed (all if it is \code{0}).
This paramter is valid if the given method supports 
built-in ordering of the eigvenvectors.
The default value is \code{0}, that means computing of all the components.}

\item{iter}{The maximum number of iterations.
The parameter is valid for the stepwise algorithm by Trendafilov,
that is applied in the power algorithm for estimation a single component.
The default value is 30.}

\item{threshold}{The threshold value of the captured variance,
which is reserved for further extensions.}

\item{...}{Other parameters.}
}
\value{
A list several slots: \code{CPC} rotation matrix with eigenvectors in columns;
  \code{ncomp} the number of components evaluated (equal to the number of columns in \code{CPC}).
}
\description{
This function computes the CPCA from a given set of covariance matrices 
(of different groups).
}
\details{
Currently, the only the stepwise algorithm by Trendafilov is supported.
}
\note{
This function adpats the original code in matlab written by Dr N. T. Trendafilov.

\examples{
require(plyr)

data(iris)

C <- daply(iris, "Species", function(x) cov(x[, -ncol(x)]))
C <- aperm(C, c(2, 3, 1)) # put the 1st dimension to the end

# default call
mod1 <- cpc(C)
round(mod1$CPC, 2)

# compute only first two CPCs
mod2 <- cpc(C, k = 2)
round(mod2$CPC, 2)
